  title: "Global Climate Summit Reaches Historic Agreement on Renewable Energy Transition",
  summary: "World leaders unite in unprecedented commitment to accelerate clean energy adoption and reduce carbon emissions by 50% before 2030.",
  content: `
    <p>In a landmark decision that could reshape the global energy landscape, representatives from 195 countries have reached a comprehensive agreement at the Global Climate Summit held in Geneva this week.</p>
    
    <p>The agreement, dubbed the "Geneva Accord," establishes binding commitments for nations to transition to renewable energy sources and implement stringent carbon reduction measures. Under the new framework, developed nations will provide $200 billion annually to support developing countries in their clean energy transitions.</p>
    
    <p>"This is a defining moment for our planet," said UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres during the closing ceremony. "The Geneva Accord represents the most ambitious climate action plan in human history."</p>
    
    <p>Key provisions of the agreement include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mandatory 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030</li>
      <li>Phase-out of coal-fired power plants by 2035</li>
      <li>$500 billion global investment in renewable energy infrastructure</li>
      <li>Establishment of international carbon pricing mechanisms</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The accord has received widespread support from environmental groups, though some critics argue that the timeline may be too ambitious for practical implementation. Markets responded positively, with renewable energy stocks surging globally.</p>
    
    <p>Implementation begins immediately, with the first progress reports due within six months. The agreement will be reviewed and potentially strengthened every five years, ensuring continuous progress toward global climate objectives.</p>
